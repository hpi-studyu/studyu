# SonarQube — Duplication

List files that contain duplicated code in a SonarQube project, then drill into **duplication blocks** for a specific file when needed.

## Usage

```
sonar-duplication                              # all duplicated files in the current project (auto-paginated)
sonar-duplication my-project                   # duplicated files in a specific project
sonar-duplication my-project --pr 42           # same, on a pull request
sonar-duplication my-project --page-size 100 --page 2   # single page of results (manual pagination)
sonar-duplication my-project --file src/auth/login.py   # duplication detail for one file
```

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the SonarQube MCP Server to be configured and the tools `mcp__sonarqube__search_duplicated_files` and `mcp__sonarqube__get_duplications` to be available in your session.

**Before proceeding**, verify the tools are accessible. If they are not, try the `sonar api` CLI fallback in Step 3 before giving up — don't invent other CLI commands (e.g. `sonar mcp call` or `sonar duplication` do not exist).

**If the CLI fallback also fails (for example `sonar` not installed/authenticated, or no project key can be resolved), narrow down the cause** — check whether the `sonarqube` MCP server is enabled in this agent's configuration.

- **Not enabled / not registered** → recommend running the sonar-integrate skill.
- **Enabled but its tools are still unavailable** → configuration is correct but the server failed to start. The most common cause is that the container runtime is not running — the MCP server launches inside Docker/Podman/Nerdctl via `sonar run mcp`, so a correctly configured server still produces no tools if the daemon is stopped. Run `docker ps` yourself (falling back to `podman ps` / `nerdctl ps`) to confirm which cause applies: if it errors, the runtime is down; after the user starts it, confirm the same command succeeds before asking them to restart the agent session.

Either way, show the user:

> Unable to reach the SonarQube MCP Server, or project key not found.
>
> **Possible causes:**
> - MCP server not registered — invoke the sonar-integrate skill to configure the SonarQube MCP Server, then restart the agent session
> - Container runtime not running — the SonarQube MCP Server runs inside a container (Docker, Podman, or Nerdctl); start your container runtime, then restart the agent session
> - Credentials not configured — invoke the sonar-integrate skill
> - Project key is wrong or no default project in MCP config — pass an explicit key, or verify `sonar-project.properties` / re-run the sonar-integrate skill for this project

Then ask the user (yes/no) whether to run the sonar-integrate skill now. Briefly explain what it does: it checks the SonarQube setup on their machine — installing or updating `sonarqube-cli` and verifying authentication — and re-configures the integration for this agent, including the SonarQube MCP server and secrets-scanning hooks. If they confirm, invoke the sonar-integrate skill yourself and follow it end-to-end in this session, then ask the user to ensure a container runtime (Docker, Podman, or Nerdctl) is running and to restart the agent session so the new MCP tools become available; if they decline, stop.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Resolve the project key (only when needed)

MCP tools sometimes **do not require** `projectKey` after the sonar-integrate skill has stored the default project for this workspace. Resolve a key only when you must pass it (tool schema requires it, or the user targets another project):

- If the user provided a project key, use it.
- Otherwise look for `sonar.projectKey` in `sonar-project.properties` at the repo root.
- If still not found, **omit `projectKey`** in MCP calls and rely on the integration default.

### Step 2: Parse optional flags from the user-provided arguments

| Flag              | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--pr <id>`       | Pull request context (maps to `pullRequest`)                                                                 |
| `--page-size <n>` | Results per page for **manual** pagination only; integer 1–500 (maps to `pageSize`)                          |
| `--page <n>`      | Page number for **manual** pagination; starts at **1** (maps to `pageIndex`)                                 |
| `--file <key>`    | Skip the duplicated-files list; fetch duplication blocks for this file (maps to `key` in `get_duplications`) |

**Pagination rule:** By default, call `search_duplicated_files` **without** `pageSize` or `pageIndex` so the MCP server auto-fetches every page of duplicated files (up to **10,000** files). Use `pageSize` and `pageIndex` only when the user asks for a specific page or wants to limit page size. If the user supplies `--page-size` but not `--page`, use `pageIndex` **1**.

### Step 3: Run the appropriate flow

#### Flow A — Duplicated file list (default, no `--file`)

Call `mcp__sonarqube__search_duplicated_files`.

**Default (auto-fetch all pages):**

Include **`projectKey` only if** you resolved one in Step 1 **and** the tool requires it; otherwise omit it.

```json
{
  "projectKey": "<only-if-required>",
  "pullRequest": "<id>"
}
```

Omit `pullRequest` when `--pr` was not given. Omit `pageSize` and `pageIndex` entirely so all duplicated files are retrieved automatically. Omit `projectKey` from the payload when the integration default applies.

**Manual pagination (single page):**

```json
{
  "projectKey": "<only-if-required>",
  "pullRequest": "<id>",
  "pageSize": <n>,
  "pageIndex": <n>
}
```

The tool returns **only files that have duplications**. Present results in a table. Include columns the response provides (for example path, duplicated line counts, or density); sort by the strongest duplication signal if multiple metrics exist (for example highest duplicated-lines density or count first).

```markdown
## Duplication — `my-project`

Files with duplications:

| File                 | Duplicated lines (example) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| src/auth/login.py    | 42                         |
| src/utils/helpers.py | 18                         |
```

If the list is empty: *"No duplicated files were returned for this project/branch/PR."*

Then offer to drill in:

*"Ask me to open duplications for any file, or invoke the sonar-duplication skill with `--file <file-key>` (add a project key only if needed)."*

**If `mcp__sonarqube__search_duplicated_files` is unavailable, fall back to `sonar api`.** This needs an explicit project key (no MCP default) — if none was resolved in Step 1, ask the user or invoke sonar-list-projects, then stop.

```bash
sonar api get "/api/measures/component_tree?component=<project-key>&metricKeys=duplicated_lines,duplicated_blocks,duplicated_lines_density&qualifiers=FIL&strategy=leaves[&pullRequest=<id>]"
```

Use `metricKeys`; add `-v` if a call 400s unexpectedly. Manual pagination maps to `&p=<page>&ps=<page-size>`; there's no auto-fetch-all mode, so page yourself up to the 10,000-file cap if needed. Filter out components with all-zero duplication metrics, then present the same table as above.

#### Flow B — Duplication detail (`--file <key>` given, or user asks to inspect a file)

Call `mcp__sonarqube__get_duplications`:

```json
{
  "key": "<file-key>",
  "pullRequest": "<id>"
}
```

The file key format is `<projectKey>:<path>`, e.g. `my-project:src/auth/login.py`. If the user provides just a path, prepend the resolved project key when you have one; otherwise follow the MCP tool schema for the default project. Omit `pullRequest` when `--pr` was not given.

> **Permission:** This call requires **Browse** permission on the file’s project. If the tool returns a permission or authorization error, tell the user they need the **Browse** role on the project and that they may need a role with code-view access.

Present duplication **blocks** from the response: for each block, show ranges, sibling copies, or other fields returned by the API so the user can see where code is duplicated.

```markdown
## Duplication detail — `src/auth/login.py`

### Block 1
- Lines 10–24 (example) duplicated in `src/other/helper.py` lines 30–44
...
```

If the file has no duplications in the response, say: *"No duplications were reported for this file."*

**If `mcp__sonarqube__get_duplications` is unavailable, fall back to `sonar api`:**

```bash
sonar api get "/api/duplications/show?key=<file-key>[&pullRequest=<id>]"
```

Omit `pullRequest` when `--pr` was not given. The same **Browse** permission requirement applies. Present the returned blocks in the same format as above.

If this also fails, show the standard message above — don't guess further commands.

### Step 4: Next steps

- To refactor: *"Ask me to extract a shared helper or consolidate the duplicated regions."*
- To scan the same file for issues: *"Invoke the sonar-analyze skill with `<file>`."*
- To check the quality gate (e.g. `new_duplicated_lines_density`): *"Invoke the sonar-quality-gate skill (add a project key only if you are not using the integration default)."*
