## Corner radius scale — 10 steps

M3 uses a **size-based scale of ten styles**, assigned by desired roundedness. This replaced M2's
3-level scale that was based on container size.

| Style | Value | Token (Compose) |
|---|---|---|
| None | 0dp | `CornerNone` (RectangleShape) |
| Extra small | 4dp | `CornerExtraSmall` |
| Small | 8dp | `CornerSmall` |
| Medium | 12dp | `CornerMedium` |
| Large | 16dp | `CornerLarge` |
| **Large increased** | **20dp** | `CornerLargeIncreased` |
| Extra large | 28dp | `CornerExtraLarge` |
| **Extra large increased** | **32dp** | `CornerExtraLargeIncreased` |
| **Extra extra large** | **48dp** | `CornerExtraExtraLarge` |
| Full | fully rounded | `CornerFull` (CircleShape) |

**Bold = added by the M3 Expressive update (May 2025).** The same update redefined fully rounded
corners to use **full** — previously it was defined as 50% of component size.

Partial-corner variants exist for sheets/menus/drawers: `CornerExtraLargeTop` (28dp top only),
`CornerExtraSmallTop`, `CornerLargeTop`, `CornerLargeStart`, `CornerLargeEnd`. Individual corners
use **corner-value** tokens (`CornerValueMedium` etc.) — these are what **inner corner** component
tokens map to.

### Optical roundness (required when nesting)

Never use the same radius for a container and its nested child; the corners look unbalanced.

```
inner radius = outer radius − padding      e.g. 48dp − 14dp = 34dp
```

## Type scale — 30 styles (15 baseline + 15 emphasized)

Five roles (display, headline, title, body, label) × three sizes (large, medium, small) × two sets.
Both sets follow the same scale. Scale ratio: **Major Second (1.125)**, base size **14**.

Token form: `md.sys.typescale.display-large` → emphasized is
`md.sys.typescale.emphasized.display-large`. Components do **not** use emphasized styles by default;
you swap the token.

### Baseline

| Style | Size | Line height | Tracking | Weight | Typeface |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display large | 57sp | 64sp | −0.2sp | Regular | Brand |
| Display medium | 45sp | 52sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Display small | 36sp | 44sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Headline large | 32sp | 40sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Headline medium | 28sp | 36sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Headline small | 24sp | 32sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Title large | 22sp | 28sp | 0sp | Regular | Brand |
| Title medium | 16sp | 24sp | 0.2sp | Medium | Plain |
| Title small | 14sp | 20sp | 0.1sp | Medium | Plain |
| Body large | 16sp | 24sp | 0.5sp | Regular | Plain |
| Body medium | 14sp | 20sp | 0.2sp | Regular | Plain |
| Body small | 12sp | 16sp | 0.4sp | Regular | Plain |
| Label large | 14sp | 20sp | 0.1sp | Medium | Plain |
| Label medium | 12sp | 16sp | 0.5sp | Medium | Plain |
| Label small | 11sp | 16sp | 0.5sp | Medium | Plain |

### Emphasized (M3 Expressive, May 2025)

Same size and line height as baseline in every case. **Only weight and tracking change.**

| Style | Size | Line height | Tracking | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display large emph. | 57sp | 64sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Display medium emph. | 45sp | 52sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Display small emph. | 36sp | 44sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Headline large emph. | 32sp | 40sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Headline medium emph. | 28sp | 36sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Headline small emph. | 24sp | 32sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Title large emph. | 22sp | 28sp | 0sp | Medium |
| Title medium emph. | 16sp | 24sp | 0.15sp | **Bold** |
| Title small emph. | 14sp | 20sp | 0.1sp | **Bold** |
| Body large emph. | 16sp | 24sp | 0.15sp | Medium |
| Body medium emph. | 14sp | 20sp | 0.25sp | Medium |
| Body small emph. | 12sp | 16sp | 0.4sp | Medium |
| Label large emph. | 14sp | 20sp | 0.1sp | **Bold** |
| Label medium emph. | 12sp | 16sp | 0.5sp | **Bold** |
| Label small emph. | 11sp | 16sp | 0.5sp | **Bold** |

Note the pattern: display/headline/title-large/body go Regular→Medium; **title medium/small and all
label sizes go Medium→Bold**. Display/headline/title-large tracking normalizes to exactly 0.

### Typeface slots

- **Brand** typeface — larger styles (display, headline, title large). Optimize for expression.
- **Plain** typeface — smaller styles (body, label, title medium/small). Optimize for readability.
- Roboto is the default for both. Baseline and emphasized sets may use different typefaces.

### Unit conversion

| | Android | Web |
|---|---|---|
| Font size | sp | rem (`sp / 16`) |
| Letter spacing | em | rem — `tracking_px / font_size = value` |

10sp = 0.625rem · 12sp = 0.75rem · 24sp = 1.5rem · 60sp = 3.75rem

## Motion springs

A spring = **stiffness + damping + initial velocity**. Two schemes × three speeds × two styles.
Token form: `md.sys.motion.spring.fast.spatial`. The scheme (`expressive` / `standard`) is **not**
part of the token name — it is applied at product level, so schemes swap without retokenizing.

### Expressive scheme (Material's recommended default)

| Token | Damping | Stiffness |
|---|---|---|
| Default spatial | 0.8 | 380 |
| Fast spatial | 0.6 | 800 |
| Slow spatial | 0.8 | 200 |
| Default effects | 1.0 | 1600 |
| Fast effects | 1.0 | 3800 |
| Slow effects | 1.0 | 800 |

### Standard scheme (utilitarian products)

| Token | Damping | Stiffness |
|---|---|---|
| Default spatial | 0.9 | 700 |
| Fast spatial | 0.9 | 1400 |
| Slow spatial | 0.9 | 300 |
| Default effects | 1.0 | 1600 |
| Fast effects | 1.0 | 3800 |
| Slow effects | 1.0 | 800 |

Read the numbers: **effects springs are identical across both schemes and always damping 1.0** (no
overshoot, by design — they carry color and opacity). All expression lives in the **spatial**
damping: expressive 0.6–0.8 (bounces) vs standard 0.9 (barely).

Spring token values differ per device class (wearable / phone / tablet) so "fast" always feels fast
in context. The relative ordering is guaranteed; the absolute values above are the Compose set.

### Web: spring → cubic-bezier + duration

Use real springs where possible. These curves are the sanctioned fallback for animations with no
interruption or gesture.

| Spring | cubic-bezier | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Expressive fast spatial | 0.42, 1.67, 0.21, 0.90 | 350ms |
| Expressive default spatial | 0.38, 1.21, 0.22, 1.00 | 500ms |
| Expressive slow spatial | 0.39, 1.29, 0.35, 0.98 | 650ms |
| Expressive fast effects | 0.31, 0.94, 0.34, 1.00 | 150ms |
| Expressive default effects | 0.34, 0.80, 0.34, 1.00 | 200ms |
| Expressive slow effects | 0.34, 0.88, 0.34, 1.00 | 300ms |
| Standard fast spatial | 0.27, 1.06, 0.18, 1.00 | 350ms |
| Standard default spatial | 0.27, 1.06, 0.18, 1.00 | 500ms |
| Standard slow spatial | 0.27, 1.06, 0.18, 1.00 | 750ms |
| Standard fast effects | 0.31, 0.94, 0.34, 1.00 | 150ms |
| Standard default effects | 0.34, 0.80, 0.34, 1.00 | 200ms |
| Standard slow effects | 0.34, 0.88, 0.34, 1.00 | 300ms |

The y1 > 1 values (1.67, 1.21, 1.29, 1.06) are the overshoot — that is the bounce. Effects curves
never exceed 1.

### Legacy easing and duration (fallback system, still used by transitions)

Durations: short 1–4 = 50/100/150/200ms · medium 1–4 = 250/300/350/400ms ·
long 1–4 = 450/500/550/600ms · extra-long 1–4 = 700/800/900/1000ms

Easing: emphasized `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` · emphasized accelerate `(0.3, 0, 0.8, 0.15)` ·
emphasized decelerate `(0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1)` · standard `(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` ·
standard accelerate `(0.3, 0, 1, 1)` · standard decelerate `(0, 0, 0, 1)` ·
legacy `(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` · linear `(0, 0, 1, 1)`

The physics system **replaces** easing-and-duration. Use springs for new work.

## Contrast levels

Three tokenized levels, applied automatically across light and dark theme:

| Level | Guarantee | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Standard (default) | mixed high/low contrast | reduces cognitive load via hierarchy |
| Medium | min **3:1** | for users who need more contrast but get halation discomfort at high |
| High | **7:1** | applied to card *content*, not the card container |

Text minimums: **3:1 large text · 4.5:1 small text.**

## Color scheme generation

26 standard color roles (45 including add-on roles). Source color → algorithm → **5 key colors**
(primary, secondary, tertiary, neutral, neutral variant) → tonal palettes → roles → UI.

Tonal palettes are numbered **0–100 in increments of 10, plus 95, 98, 99**. Colors are defined in
**HCT**: hue 0–360 (circular), chroma 0 to ~120 max, tone 0 (black) – 100 (white).

Accessible pairing is by tone distance: tones 50/98 ≈ 3:1; tones 30/98 ≈ 7:1.

## Elevation

Six levels: level 0 = 0dp, level 1 = 1dp, level 2 = 3dp, level 3 = 6dp, level 4 = 8dp,
level 5 = 12dp.

Surface color in M3 is **tone-based, not elevation-derived** — the old "+1 to +5 elevation overlay"
approach was replaced by `surface container` roles. Do not tie surface color to elevation.
