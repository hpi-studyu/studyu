The StudyU Designer is a web-based application supporting the design and
implementation of digital N-of-1 trials for clinicians, researchers, or digital
health enthusiasts. With its user-centric design framework, the StudyU Designer
improves usability with many supportive features during the study creation
process. Notably, it includes a preview function that provides a real-time
visualization of the study design. Besides running private N-of-1 trials,
seamless collaboration with other researchers is also supported by sharing
studies, fostering collaboration and transparency in the spirit of public health
and open science.

The StudyU App is a user-friendly application that
enables individuals to actively participate in digital N-of-1 trials and obtain
personalized treatment advice. Its accessible design approach accommodates users
with limited technical skills, allowing them to directly measure the impact of
interventions on their health outcomes. By engaging patients in the trial process,
the StudyU App promotes patient empowerment and facilitates shared
decision-making between researchers, clinicians, and individuals. The StudyU App
leverages the capabilities of statistical computing and advanced machine learning
models to identify the optimal intervention tailored specifically to your unique
needs and circumstances.

The StudyU App is primarily intended for use on smartphones, so it is
recommended to download it on a mobile device by using the app store links
provided, in order for reminder notifications to work properly. Alternatively, it
is also possible to access the StudyU App as a web application if desired.
