# StudyU Repository Instructions

This is a Flutter/Dart monorepo. All agent work starts and runs from the repository root.
Treat these instructions as a concise operating contract, not a replacement for the source
code, tests, or linked project documentation.

## Working Principles

- Inspect the relevant implementation, tests, callers, dependents, and documentation before
  changing behavior. Use structural/code-graph tools when available; otherwise locate code with
  filename and symbol search, then trace definitions and impact before editing.
- Check whether the requested approach is correct. Surface a material flaw or a simpler and
  safer alternative before implementing it.
- Resolve ordinary uncertainty from repository evidence. Ask before implementation only when
  unresolved ambiguity materially affects behavior, compatibility, data, security, or scope.
- Prefer the smallest implementation consistent with the request, existing architecture, and
  required failure handling. Do not add speculative features, configuration, or abstractions.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested outcome. Do not include opportunistic refactors,
  unrelated formatting, dependency upgrades, or cleanup.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes and comments. Remove only imports, variables, or
  other artifacts made unused by the current change.

## Repository Map

- `core/` contains shared Dart models and logic used by both frontends.
- `flutter_common/` contains shared Flutter functionality, environment loading, and Supabase
  initialization.
- `app/` is the participant-facing Flutter application for Android, iOS, and web.
- `designer_v2/` is the researcher-facing Flutter web Designer.
- `supabase/` contains current migrations, seeds, local configuration, and database tests.
- `database/migration-legacy/` is historical and is not the current migration path.

## Sources Of Truth

- The root `pubspec.yaml` `melos.scripts` section is authoritative for commands, package
  filters, ports, and environment defines. Do not copy its script bodies into this file.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is authoritative for setup, coding conventions, commits, reviews, and PRs.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` is authoritative for PR body structure and checklists.
- Hook, CI, and package configuration files are authoritative for what tools actually enforce.
- `supabase/README.md` is authoritative for local backend setup, migrations, seeds, and database
  tests.
- When prose conflicts with executable configuration, inspect and reconcile the conflict rather
  than guessing.

## Root-Only Workflow

- Run all commands from the repository root. Do not change into a package directory for routine
  work.
- Use `fvm exec melos <script>` for root Melos scripts.
- Use `fvm dart` or `fvm flutter` for direct SDK commands. Run `fvm install` if the configured
  SDK is unavailable.
- Prefer the existing root script catalog. For a targeted package check with no catalog entry,
  use a root-level `melos exec` command with the appropriate package filter.
- The tracked `.githooks/pre-commit` hook runs `scripts/pre-commit-check` automatically.
  Run that check manually before a PR only when the hook has not checked the current changes.
- Do not use `fvm exec melos qualitycheck` as the default pre-commit or pre-PR check. Use it for
  a full CI-style workspace check or when explicitly requested.

## Environments

- The default `.env` targets production. Unqualified `app`, `designer_v2`, and default build
  scripts can therefore use production configuration.
- Use `dev:*` scripts for the development environment and `local:*` scripts for local Supabase.
- Do not run an unqualified application or build command for routine development.
- Treat environment, storage, authentication, and Supabase initialization changes as affecting
  both frontends when they touch `flutter_common/`.
- Never add service-role keys, signing keys, OAuth secrets, store credentials, private keys, or
  other privileged credentials to tracked client environment files.

## Generated Files And Dependencies

- Do not hand-edit generated Dart or localization output. Change models, annotations, ARB files,
  or other generator inputs, then run the configured root generation script.
- Generated `*.g.dart` files are tracked and must be included when regeneration changes them.
- Inspect generated diffs for unexpected API, schema, or serialization changes.
- Do not hand-edit lockfiles. For dependency work, change the manifest and use the configured
  package workflow, then review all resulting lockfile changes.
- Changes to `core/` models can affect both frontends and persisted study data. Inspect consumers
  before changing public model or serialization contracts.

## Verification

- Determine which packages and boundaries are affected, then run the narrowest relevant checks.
- Use `fvm exec melos test` for workspace Flutter unit and widget tests. This does not cover
  Designer browser E2E tests or Supabase/pgTAP tests.
- Run generation after model or annotation changes, and analyze/test affected packages after
  generated output is updated.
- Changes under `supabase/` require the database test workflow described in `supabase/README.md`
  when the relevant local dependencies are available.
- Changes to full Designer browser flows require the dedicated E2E setup and checks.
- Changes to Android, iOS, permissions, notifications, camera/audio, Fitbit, or deep links
  require the relevant platform validation when available.
- For bugs, add or identify a regression test when practical. Do not weaken tests or expected
  behavior merely to obtain a passing result.
- Before reporting completion, inspect the final diff and state exactly which checks ran, which
  passed, and what could not be verified.

## Code Reviews

- Review the complete diff in repository context. Trace changed behavior through callers,
  dependents, persistence boundaries, generated sources, tests, and relevant integrations.
- Verify each finding against the implementation before reporting it. Include the exact file and
  line. Use a question when a concern depends on missing context.
- Prioritize security, privacy, data integrity, compatibility, user-facing regressions, edge
  cases, missing tests, and concrete over-engineering risks. Do not report style preferences,
  restated diffs, or speculative improvements.
- Format every finding according to [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/):
  `<label> [decorations]: <subject>` followed by the discussion.
- Use `issue` for a verified problem, `suggestion` for an improvement, and `question` when the
  concern depends on missing context. Use `todo` or `chore` for small required work, and use
  `nitpick` only for trivial preferences.
- Use `praise`, `thought`, or `note` only when warranted. Do not manufacture praise.
- Use only `(blocking)`, `(non-blocking)`, or `(if-minor)` decorations. A blocking finding must
  identify a correctness, security, data-loss, compatibility, or required-process failure.
- Write findings in concise, plain, active English. Preserve uncertainty and scope qualifiers.
  Keep one issue per comment. Put evidence, impact, and the proposed next step in the discussion.

## Safety Boundaries

Do not run any of the following without explicit user authorization and immediate verification
of the target, environment, and data-loss impact:

- `fvm exec melos reset`, `git clean`, or other commands that discard local changes or files.
- Supabase reset commands or `scripts/reset-test-db.sh` with an unverified or non-local
  `SUPABASE_DB_URL`.
- `supabase link`, remote `db push`, remote migration commands, or any command against a remote
  database or project.
- Production seed operations. Production receives migrations only, never seeds.
- Deployments, release tags, mobile store uploads, Firebase deployments, or Pub.dev publication.
- Commands that push directly to `main` or `dev`.

Markdown instructions are not a security boundary. Keep production credentials unavailable to
routine agent sessions and use hooks, permissions, CI, and review gates for hard enforcement.

## Area-Specific Rules

### When changing `core/`

- Keep shared model and serialization contracts compatible with both frontends and active study
  data unless a breaking change is explicitly intended.
- Run `fvm exec melos generate` after model or annotation changes and commit tracked output.
- Prefer package-level tests for serialization and public model behavior.

### When changing `flutter_common/`

- Assume the change affects both `app/` and `designer_v2/`.
- Keep application-specific navigation and behavior out of shared code unless both consumers need
  it.
- Review environment and secure-storage changes for production exposure and data persistence.

### When changing `app/`

- Treat participant data, reminders, permissions, collection flows, and persistence as sensitive.
- Preserve established Provider, GoRouter, Material theme, responsive layout, and localization
  patterns. Prefer theme values over hardcoded colors.
- Validate relevant native platforms when changing Android or iOS configuration or integrations.

### When changing `designer_v2/`

- Preserve established Riverpod, reactive-form, routing, repository, and localization patterns.
- Run generation after Riverpod or other annotation changes.
- Use the dedicated browser E2E checks for full Designer flows when applicable.
- Treat study deletion, publishing, exports, and participant-data operations as data-integrity
  sensitive.

### When changing `supabase/`

- Add current migrations only under `supabase/migrations/`.
- Review RLS, grants, authentication, cascades, and participant-data changes for security and
  data loss, and add or update pgTAP coverage for relevant invariants.
- Verify database targets are local before reset or seed operations.
- Read `supabase/README.md` before changing migration, seed, or test workflows.

### When changing `database/`

- Treat `database/migration-legacy/` as historical reference only.
- Put new database changes under `supabase/migrations/`.

### When changing `.github/`

- Treat workflow changes as production-impacting because workflows can deploy, release,
  publish, auto-commit, or access privileged secrets.
- Preserve least-privilege permissions, secret references, triggers, and environment boundaries.
- Validate workflow syntax and behavior without triggering a deployment or release.

## Git And Pull Requests

- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`; do not invent generic commit messages or duplicate its conventions.
- When creating a pull request, use `.agents/skills/pull-request/SKILL.md` for the procedural
  workflow. It covers branch and commit validation, diff auditing, testing, and PR creation.
- The pull-request skill must use `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the live PR body schema,
  complete it from the actual diff and verification, and remind the user about required UI
  screenshots or video.
- Do not revert unrelated changes. All worktrees must be created under `.worktrees/` relative to
  the repository root, for example `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch-name> <branch>`.
