  "what_is_studyu": "What is StudyU?",
  "description_part1": "Imagine reading the sentence: \"Eating after 6 pm decreases sleep quality\"",
  "description_part2": "Now you might think something like: Well... good to know but is that affecting everyone and also ME?",
  "description_part3": "The problem is: you did not take part in the study yourself, so we simply cannot answer that question. A traditional study can only answer whether it is more LIKELY that your sleep quality is affected. You would therefore have to test the effect of eating late on YOUR sleep.",
  "description_part4": "This means that you would have to do your own personal study, in which you would have phases of eating late and phases of abstaining from eating late. You would regularly assess your sleep quality and in the end come to a result that could finally answer the question of whether eating late decreases your sleep quality or not. Giving you a reliable answer to such questions is the goal of StudyU.",
  "description_part5": "StudyU offers the possibility to enroll to N-of-1 studies designed by experts. N-of-1 means that the number of people in the trials, which is usually indicated as N, is 1. And just like traditional trials, N-of-1 trials need a clearly defined plan (a so-called study protocol).",
  "description_part6": "And because good study protocols are not easy to make, we have developed this App. Here you can choose between different N-of-1 studies, according to YOUR personal interest, and you will automatically receive a plan developed by experts that will give you a reliable result.",
  "description_part7": "Once you have chosen one of our studies we will make sure that your health status allows participation. Afterwards you can enroll as a participant and adapt the study plan to your everyday life. Tasks (e.g. eating late and rating your tiredness) have to be done on a regular basis (e.g. once per day). Once you have reached the minimum study duration (usually just a few weeks) you will be able to unlock results for free.",
  "description_part8": "But bear in mind that results are more reliable the longer you take actively part in the study. And in order to prevent systematic error you cannot go on with the study after unlocking results. Therefore, with the help of a progress bar we will indicate you how many tasks are still needed for the minimum and how much you could improve your results with going on for some more weeks.",
  "description_part9": "But enough from our side, now it's time for StudyU!",
